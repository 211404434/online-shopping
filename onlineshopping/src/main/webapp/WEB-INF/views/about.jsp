		<h1>About Us</h1>
		<hr/>
		<p>Pick n Pay Stores Limited, through its subsidiaries and associates, operates in the retail sector on the African continent.</p>
<p>Pick n Pay is the quintessential family store focused on the customer. Since 1967 when consumer champion Raymond Ackerman purchased the first few stores, the Ackerman family&rsquo;s vision has grown and expanded to now encompass stores in South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Zambia, Mozambique, Mauritius, Swaziland and Lesotho. Additionally Pick n Pay owns a 49% share of a Zimbabwean supermarket business, TM Supermarkets. Our offer to customers focuses on groceries, clothing and general merchandise, but also includes additional value-added services to cater for our customers&rsquo; expectations and evolving needs. To ensure a convenient and accessible shopping experience the Group operates across multiple store formats, both franchised and owned.</p>
<p>For the past 5 years the Group&rsquo;s core focus has been to strengthen its strong South African retail businesses under the Pick n Pay and Boxer brands, while adopting a systematic approach to expanding into adjacent areas, including geographical growth through the African continent.</p>
<p>As a major retailer in Africa, the Group strives to address socio-economic challenges through the supply of high-quality, affordable food for all customers, while providing significant employment and economic opportunities across its value chain. The growth and success of Pick n Pay is attributable to 3 basic principles, which form the cornerstone of the business: Consumer sovereignty; Doing good is good business; and maximising business efficiency.</p>
